In the dark we quack!

We are old friends who make small tools tailored to our needs and share them, hoping that they come in handy to others as well.

Projects in here are only one possible path taken in the labyrinth of our ideas. We are sure to come with more, and we'd be absolutely delighted to get back where we may have left off. So feel free to make PRs.

Projects are usually directed towards being modules of micro-services. They include an audio and video recorder, a message bus, floating multi-purpose webapp windows, and more.

And let’s always remind ourselves, that open-sourcery is the magic that fosters a better, more transparent, and humane world. ◦°˚\(*❛‿❛)/˚°◦
